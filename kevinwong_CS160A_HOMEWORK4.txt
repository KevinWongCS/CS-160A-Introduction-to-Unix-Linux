Homework #4
Due date  (9/28/2021).
Each question is worth 4 points.

1) Please show the last 10 students login-ids on hills. Please make sure to display
   the login-ids only. The login-ids are all part of the /etc/passwd file.
   Please show your command.

tail /etc/passwd | cut  -d":"  -f1
  
   
   use cut command, user names have no patterns so regex or grep isn't good in this case.
   

2) Using the "date" command, please display the "year" field of this command.
   You need to use the "cut" command to answer this question.

date | cut -d" " -f6

3) The 7th field of the /etc/passwd file is representing the "shell". Please
   show how to display the first 10 shells from the /etc/passwd file on hills.
   You need to display only the shells from this file. 

head /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f7

4) Please show how to count number of users who are currently lodged-in to hills.

who | wc -l

5) What are the contents of the file "myfile" when the following commands are
   completed:
   echo "good bad nice ugly pretty"  > myfile; sort myfile > myfile; cat myfile
   You need to explain what is really happening.

The contents of "myfile" are "null" or no content after the commands are completed. 
I believe the command intended to sort the text: "good", "bad", "nice", "ugly", 
and "pretty", but the text was entered as a single line of text, so "sort myfile"
wouldn't do anything. 

The "sort myfile > myfile" also doesn't work because the ">" redirection operator has
precedence before the "sort" command, so the command is literally creating an empty file
"myfile", sorting it, and storing the stdout from "sort" command.
