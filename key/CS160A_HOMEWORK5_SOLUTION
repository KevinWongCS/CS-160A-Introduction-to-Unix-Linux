                              CS160A Homework5 Solution
                              -------------------------

1) In your home directory on hills, create a soft link to our public directory
   Name of the link should be "cs160a". You need to show me your command.
cd
ln -s /pub/cs/amoghtan/cs160a cs160a

2) How many soft links are in the /etc subdirectory? You ned to show me your command.

 ls -l /etc/ | grep '^l' | wc -l
14

3) In /bin on hills, how many commands consist of only 2 letters. For example
   cp, mv, ls, and so forth.
   You need to show me your command.
cd /bin
ls | grep "^..$" | wc -l
43

4) Please show me how many times the word "Linux" is repeated in the file
CS160A_LESSON6. 
You need to show me your command.

grep "Linux" CS160A_LESSON6

grep  "Linux" CS160A_LESSON6 | wc -l
6
Since "Linux" is repeated once/line, the above command works well. We can also
do:
grep  -c "Linux" CS160A_LESSON6

But if "Linux" shows several times per line, then the better solution is:
grep  -o "Linux" CS160A_LESSON6 | wc -l


5) Please show the names of those folders in the /etc directory on hills that have
7 hard links. How many of them are there?
You need to show me your commands.

cd /etc
ls -l | grep "^d" | tr -s ' ' ' ' | cut -d' ' -f2 | grep "^7$" | wc -l

The answer is:
4
