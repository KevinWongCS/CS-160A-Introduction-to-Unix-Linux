1) Using wildcards, display those filenames in our public directory on hills, that

ls ?

3) The file /etc/passwd has records about all of the users on hills. Each record
in this file belongs to one user.
Please show the total numbers of users on hills. Please show your command.

9407 users
wc -l < /etc/passwd

4) Please explain why the output of the following commands is not the same:

echo "John" | wc -l
echo -n "John" | wc -l

echo "John" | wc -l would output 1 because a new line trails after "echo" outputs "John". So the
line count would be "1".
echo -n "John" | wc -l would output 0 because the "-n" option removes the trailing new-line after
outputting "John". So the line count would be "0".
