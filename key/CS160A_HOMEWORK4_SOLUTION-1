                        Solution To CS160A Homework #4
                        ------------------------------


1) Please show the last 10 students login-ids on hills. Please make sure to display
   the login-ids only. The login-ids are all part of the /etc/passwd file.


tail /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1 

The output is:

ktoy9
zrivera4
dstine
mkellom1
cmonson11
mbertent
gkhoury2
ngilber6
bhall14
mthom227

2) Using the "date" command, please display the "year" field of this command.
   You need to use the "cut" command to answer this question.


date | cut -d' ' -f6


3) The 7th field of the /etc/passwd file is representing the "shell". Please
   show how to display the first 10 shells from the /etc/passwd file on hills.
   You need to display only the shells from this file. 


head /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f7 

The output is:

/bin/bash
/sbin/nologin
/sbin/nologin
/sbin/nologin
/sbin/nologin
/bin/sync
/sbin/shutdown
/sbin/halt
/sbin/nologin
/sbin/nologin

4) Please show how to count number of users who are currently logged-in to hills.


who | wc -l


5) What are the contents of the file "myfile" when the following commands are
   completed:

   echo "good bad nice ugly pretty"  > myfile; sort myfile > myfile; cat myfile

   You need to explain what is really happening.


The file myfile is empty when the commands are completed.

It first creates a file named "myfile" in the current directory.
Then the echo command writes the content "good bad nice ugly pretty" into myfile.
But the sort myfile > myfile command actually deletes everything in the myfile in
the first place, so when the sort command executes, there's nothing in myfile.
Therefore, when we use the cat myfile command, there's nothing displaying, because the
file is empty by then.
